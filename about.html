        Some time ago I decided to change my career path and try something new
        and exciting.
        <br /><br />
        Because of my interest in technology I wanted to start exploring that
        field.<br /><br />
        After a lot of research, I got to the conclusion that web development
        was a great way for me to enter the IT world.<br /><br />

        Each line of code made me more passionate about coding and creating web
        pages and apps. Coding is a way for me to express my creativity and
        satisfy my need for knowledge and constant improvement.<br /><br />

        While learning how to code I worked as an online English tutor. I
        started teaching during my studies at university. I hold a Bachelor's
        and Master's degree in Environmental Engineering. My love for learning
        led me to graduate at top of my class.<br /><br />

        Since my formal education is not related to web development, I owe my
        coding skills to vast online resources (freeCodeCamp, W3Schools, Scrimba
        , YouTube, etc.) and a lot of time, effort, and discipline on my side.
        Skills that I acquired and still mastering are HTML, CSS, Sass,
        Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery and ReactJS. I'm sure that with time and
        experience this list will get longer. <br /><br />
